#### Bodged vue-g

I'm studying electron and vue. I've not yet figured out how electron can load vue with its build-in runtime compiler. This package will automatically load the 'full' vue source file which contains this runtime compiler.

webpack, browserify, etc, all speak of 'alias', alas I cannot find such option in electron. This will do for today.

The additional purpose of this exercise is to learn about the (npm|yarn)/electron ecosystem; a boiler-plate project is too simple.

install with: `npm install Gerjo/vue#dev --save`

happy hacking.
